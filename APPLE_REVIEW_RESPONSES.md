## Response to Guideline 3.1.1 - Account Registration Removed

We have removed all account registration features from the app per your feedback.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed the "Create Account" / "Sign Up" option from the login screen
- Removed the company registration flow entirely
- The app now only allows existing customers (who purchased externally) to sign in
- New users see "Existing customers only. Contact sales for access." message

**How It Works Now:**
1. Users can only sign in with existing credentials (provisioned by our sales team)
2. Users can explore full app functionality via Demo Mode (no account required)
3. To become a customer, users must contact sales externally (email/phone)
4. There is no self-service account creation in the app

## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Demo Account Issue

We have updated the app to include a built-in Demo Mode for review purposes.

**How to access Demo Mode:**
1. Open the app to the login screen
2. Tap "Try Demo Mode" link (visible below the login button)
3. Select any role to explore: Super Admin, Company Admin, Manager, or Bartender
4. Full app functionality is immediately accessible

No username or password is required. The Demo Mode provides complete access to all app features including:
- Real-time inventory dashboard
- Staff time tracking with facial recognition demo
- Device management and monitoring
- Analytics and reporting
- Security settings (including account deletion)
- All navigation and features

## Response to Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Account Deletion

Account deletion is fully implemented and accessible within the app.

**Location of Account Deletion Feature:**

1. Log in to the app (or use Demo Mode with any role)
2. Navigate to **Security Center** (shield icon in the sidebar menu)
3. Select the **"Account"** tab (the rightmost tab, marked with a trash icon)
4. Tap the red **"Delete My Account"** button
5. In the confirmation dialog, type **DELETE** in the text field
6. Tap **"Delete Account"** to permanently delete the account

**What gets deleted:**
- User account and profile information
- All shift records and clock-in history
- Face recognition data
- Security and authentication settings
- All associated data and preferences

This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Users are clearly informed of this before confirming deletion.

**Note:** This is a standard account deletion flow that does not require contacting customer service. The deletion is initiated and completed entirely within the app.

## Response to Guideline 2.1 - Business Model Questions

### 1. Who are the users that will use the paid features in the app?

Business customers including bars, restaurants, retail stores, and enterprise organizations who have purchased Invepin inventory tracking hardware and software subscriptions through our direct B2B sales process. These are commercial entities, not individual consumers.

### 2. Where can users purchase the features that can be accessed in the app?

Features are purchased through direct contact with our sales team:
- **Email:** support@invepin.com
- **Phone:** 302-343-5004

We operate a B2B enterprise sales model. There are no in-app purchases. Customers contact our sales team, receive a quote, sign an enterprise agreement, and are then provisioned with account access.

### 3. What specific types of previously purchased features can a user access in the app?

After purchasing an enterprise subscription externally, business customers can access:
- Real-time inventory tracking and monitoring dashboards
- Staff time tracking with facial recognition clock-in/out
- IoT device management for Invepin hardware (sensors, trackers)
- Loss prevention analytics and alerts
- Multi-location store management
- Team communication tools
- Reporting and business intelligence features

### 4. What paid content, subscriptions, or features are unlocked within your app that do not use in-app purchase?

This app does not unlock any paid content within the app itself. The app serves as an operational tool for businesses that have already purchased Invepin enterprise subscriptions through external B2B sales channels.

The app authenticates existing enterprise customers and provides them access to manage their business operations. No digital content, subscriptions, or features can be purchased through the app.

### 5. Do users have to pay a fee to create an account?

This app does not support self-service account creation. Accounts are provisioned by our sales team for customers who have purchased enterprise subscriptions externally. Anyone can explore the app using Demo Mode without any account.

The app does not collect any payments. Enterprise subscriptions are purchased through B2B sales channels outside the app.

### 6. Are the enterprise services in your app sold to single users, consumers, or for family use?

No. Invepin is exclusively B2B enterprise software. Our services are sold only to:
- Businesses (bars, restaurants, retail stores)
- Enterprise organizations
- Commercial entities

We do not sell to individual consumers, single users for personal use, or families. Our minimum engagement is a business-level subscription that includes hardware devices and software access for commercial inventory management purposes.
